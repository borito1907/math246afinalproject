Also, in a different video "What does it feel like to invent math", I give a completely different example of how adding up growing positive numbers can meaningfully give a negative number, so long as you loosen your understanding of what distance should mean for numbers:    • What does it feel like to invent math?  

Interestingly, that vertical line where the convergent portion of the function appears to abruptly stop corresponds to numbers whose real part is Euler's constant, {\textasciitilde}0.577.  For those who know what this is, it's kind of fun to puzzle about why this is the case.

        log
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}log \}
  
 is the natural logarithm function. It was published by J. Barkley Rosser in 1939.
Its full statement is:
Let 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            n

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle n\}
  
th prime number. Then for 
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        1
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle n{\textbackslash}geq 1\}

        n
        .
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\_\{n\}{\textgreater}n{\textbackslash}log n.\}
  

In 1999, Pierre Dusart proved a tighter lower bound:
